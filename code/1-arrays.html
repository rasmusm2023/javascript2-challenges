  // Task 1: Create a variable called `newYearsResolutions` and set it's value to be a new array with at
  // least 3 strings inside of it.

  var newYearsResolutions = ["Resolution 1", "Resolution 2", "Resolution 3"];


  // Task 2: Create a new variable called `nextNewYearsResolution` and set it's value to the first
  // item from the newYearsResolutions array (see the docs above for a hint on how to select items
  // from arrays).

  var nextNewYearsResolution = newYearsResolutions[0];

  // Task 3: Use console.log() to print the 3rd item in the newYearsResolutions array without setting
  // any variables.

  console.log("Number 3 in new years resolution-array: ", newYearsResolutions[2])
